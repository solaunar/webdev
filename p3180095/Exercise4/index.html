                    Roots
                </h2>
                <p>The roots of modern Artificial Intelligence, or AI, can be traced back to the classical philosophers
                    of Greece, and their efforts to model human thinking as a system of symbols. More recently, in the
                    1940s, a school of thought called “Connectionism” was developed to study the process of thinking. In
                    1950, a man named Alan Turing wrote a paper suggesting how to test a “thinking” machine. He believed
                    if a machine could carry on a conversation by way of a teleprinter, imitating a human with no
                    noticeable differences, the machine could be described as thinking. His paper was followed in 1952
                    by the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the brain as neurons forming an electrical network, with individual
                    neurons firing in all-or-nothing (on/off) pulses. These events, at a conference sponsored by
                    Dartmouth College in 1956, helped to spark the concept of Artificial Intelligence.

                <p>Jonathan Crane is the CCO of Ipsoft, the creators of the virtual assistant called Amelia. He had this
                    to say about the current state of Artificial Intelligence:</p>

                <q>“AI is driving a huge change in the way we can target our marketing and advertising, even for smaller
                    companies. This means that businesses are able to target their ‘spend and increase ROI’ and allow
                    advertising to do what it should, giving people adverts they want to see.”</q>

                <p>Mr. Crane is referring to AI’s use of Big Data. Artificial Intelligence can be combined with Big Data
                    to handle complex tasks, and can process the information at much faster speeds than any previous
                    systems.</p>

                <p>The development of AI has not been streamlined and efficient. Starting as an exciting, imaginative
                    concept in 1956, Artificial Intelligence research funding was cut in the 1970s, after several
                    reports criticized a lack of progress. Efforts to imitate the human brain, called “neural networks,”
                    were experimented with, and dropped. The most impressive, functional programs were only able to
                    handle simplistic problems, and were described as toys by the unimpressed. AI researchers had been
                    overly optimistic in establishing their goals, and had made naive assumptions about the problems
                    they would encounter. When the results they promised never materialized, it should come as no
                    surprise their funding was cut.</p>

                    The First AI Winter
                </h2>
                <p>AI researchers had to deal with two very basic limitations, not enough memory, and processing speeds
                    that would seem abysmal by today’s standards. Much like gravity research at the time, Artificial
                    Intelligence research had its government funding cut, and interest dropped off. However, unlike
                    gravity, AI research resumed in the 1980s, with the U.S. and Britain providing funding to compete
                    with Japan’s new “fifth generation” computer project, and their goal of becoming the world leader in
                    computer technology. The stretch of time between 1974 and 1980 has become known as ‘The First AI
                    Winter.’</p>

                <p>The First AI Winter ended with the introduction of “Expert Systems,” which were developed and quickly
                    adopted by competitive corporations all around the world. The primary focus of AI research was now
                    on the theme of accumulating knowledge from various experts. AI also benefited from the revival of
                    Connectionism in the 1980s.!</p>

                    Cybernetics and Neural Networks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cybernetics studies automatic control systems. Two examples are the brain and nervous system, and
                    the communication systems used by computers. Cybernetics has been used to train the modern version
                    of neural networks. However, neural networks would not become financially successful until the
                    1990s, when they started being used to operate optical character recognition programs and speech
                    pattern recognition programs.</p>

                    Expert Systems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expert Systems represent an approach in Artificial Intelligence research that became popular
                    throughout the 1970s. An Expert System uses the knowledge of experts to create a program. Expert
                    Systems can answer questions and solve problems within a clearly defined arena of knowledge, and
                    uses “rules” of logic. Their simplistic design made it reasonably easy for programs to be designed,
                    built, and modified. Bank loan screening programs provide a good example of an Expert System from
                    the early 1980s, but there were also medical and sales applications using Expert Systems. Generally
                    speaking, these simple programs became quite useful, and started saving businesses large amounts of
                    money.
                <p>
                    For instance, in 1980, Digital Equipment Corporation began requiring their sales team use an Expert
                    System named XCON when placing customer orders. DEC sold a broad range of computer components, but
                    the sales force was not especially knowledgeable about what they were selling. Some orders combined
                    components that didn’t work together and some orders were missing needed components. Before XCON,
                    technical advisers would screen the orders, identify nonfunctional combinations, and provide
                    instructions for assembling the system. Since this process (including communications with the
                    customer) caused a bottleneck at DEC, and many efforts to automate it had failed, DEC was willing to
                    try a technology that was relatively new to this kind situation. By 1986, the system was saving DEC
                    $40 million annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XCON (sometimes referred to as R1) was a large system with roughly 750 rules, and even though it
                    could process multiple orders, it still needed to be adjusted and tweaked before DEC could use it
                    efficiently. DEC learned the system could not be used as originally designed, and that they did not
                    they have the expertise to maintain it. The “knowledge” in the system needed to be collected and
                    added by people trained in Expert Systems, and in knowledge acquisition. Many of its technical
                    advisers were engineers, but they were not AI experts, and the team of engineers DEC finally
                    organized were “familiar” with AI, but members of the group were not chosen for their Artificial
                    Intelligence expertise (there simply were not that many experts available), and no one in the group
                    was familiar with the language it was written in, OPS-4. After roughly a year, with a huge amount of
                    assistance from Carnegie-Mellon (the program’s original writers), and having grown to nearly 1000
                    rules, DEC was able to take over the programming and maintenance of XCON. Integrating XCON into the
                    DEC culture was a difficult, but successful experience. Management learned an Expert System requires
                    specially trained personnel, and they took responsibility for training and hiring people to meet
                    those needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its peak, XCON has 2,500 rules and had evolved significantly (though currently its popularity has
                    waned, as it has become a bit of a dinosaur). XCON was the first computer system to use AI
                    techniques in solving real world problems within an industrial setting. By 1985, corporations all
                    over the world had begun to use Expert Systems, and a new career field developed to support them.
                    XCON could configure sales orders for all VAX-11 computer systems manufactured in the United States,
                    but the system needed to be continuously adjusted and updated, and required a full-time IT team.

                    The Second AI Winter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AI field experienced another major winter from 1987 to 1993. This second slowdown in AI research
                    coincided with XCON, and other early Expert System computers, being seen as slow and clumsy. Desktop
                    computers were becoming very popular and displacing the older, bulkier, much less user-friendly
                    computer banks. Eventually, Expert Systems simply became too expensive to maintain, when compared to
                    desktops. They were difficult to update, and could not “learn.” These were problems desktop
                    computers did not have. At about the same time, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
                    concluded AI would not be “the next wave” and redirected its funds to projects deemed more likely to
                    provide quick results. As a consequence, in the late 1980s, funding for AI research was cut deeply,
                    creating the Second AI Winter.

                    Conversation with Computers Becomes a Reality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the early 1990s, Artificial Intelligence research shifted its focus to something called an
                    intelligent agent. These intelligent agents can be used for news retrieval services, online
                    shopping, and browsing the web. Intelligent agents are also sometimes called agents or bots. With
                    the use of Big Data programs, they have gradually evolved into personal digital assistants, or
                    virtual assistants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, giant tech businesses such as Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft are researching a
                    number of Artificial Intelligence projects, including virtual assistants. They are all competing to
                    create assistants such as Facebook’s M, or Cortana from Microsoft, or Apple’s Siri.The goal of
                    Artificial Intelligence is no longer to create an intelligent machine capable of imitating human
                    conversation with a teletype. The use of Big Data has allowed AI to take the next evolutionary step.
                    Now, the goals are to develop software programs capable of speaking in a natural language, like
                    English, and to act as your virtual assistant. These virtual assistants represent the future of AI
                    research, and may take the form of robots for physical help, or may be housed in laptops and help in
                    make business decisions, or they may be integrated into a business’s customer service program and
                    answer the phone. Artificial Intelligence is still evolving and finding new uses.
