                <h2>Ana's hobbies</h2>
                <p>When I said I have a curious type of personality I meant it, and that's because (quoting my words from the main page)
                    "I am actually still discovering and taking up new hobbies, dropping others in order to find the best
                    fits for me.". My main hobbies, however, consist of drawing and listening to music.
                    On this page you can take a look of my creations as well as some of my suggestions in music.

                    </figure>
                    <p>I've actually been drawing ever since I remember myself, it's something I was, am and probably will
                        be enjoying for a while more. In the pictures above you can see 2 of the drawings I've made. The first one 
                        is traditionally made with fine pen and markers, named Narcissus and inspired by Narcissus of greek mythology,
                        The second drawing is one of my attempts in digital art, using a drawing pad, it is still a piece in progress and it was inspired by the Savage Garden song, "I want you".

                    </figure>
                    <p>I've been intested in crafts overall so making accessories that match my personality is something I do 
                        quite frequently. Earrings are my all time favorite accessory so I decided to showcase some of those 
                        creations. The first pair of earrings was inspired by Jean Pierre Polnareff, character of the anime series JJBA, 
                        whereas the second was mostly one of my experiments with wire, that, in my humble opinion, succeeded.

                <p>As I have already stated I also love spending time listening to music, or taking up different art related hobbies. The picture above 
                    shows one of my attempts at sewing and embroidery, a pouch made out of old jeans styled with a cherry blossom tree embroidery. 
                    I thought I'd list some of my favorite albums as well for you to hear, hope you enjoy!
