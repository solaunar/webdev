                <h2>Studying CS at AUEB</h2>
                <p>I've been studying computer science at Athens University of Economics and Business since October 2018.
                    My progress so far has been decent, having passed most of my courses and maintaining a GPA greater than 8.5 out of 10.
                    The next section is dedicated to some of the projects I have done, in partnership with fellow students.
                </p>

                    <h3>Reversi</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="pic22.jpg" alt="Reversi" width="%" height="">
                        <figcaption>1. Reversi</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. We were asked to implement the infamous
                        Reversi (Othello) game in any programming language so that the user would play against the computer. 
                        The computer would of course use AI techniques to play, to be specific we used the MiniMax algorithm.
                        We made, aditionally to the assignment, a GUI for the game, as shown in the image above. My teammates for this
                        project were: Anastasiadou Konstantina (3180009) and Georgiadi Despoina (3180026).

                    <h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>2. Performance curves comparison for Naive Bayes</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. We were asked to implement 3 different
                        machine learning algorithms in any programming language and test their performance on a given set of data. 
                        In the images above you can see the performance curves (Accuracy, Precision - Recall) for our implementation
                        of the multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier and the sklearn BernoulliNB classifier, side by side.
                        My teammates for this project were: Anastasiadou Konstantina (3180009) and Georgiadi Despoina (3180026).</p>

                    <h3>Cambook</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="pic25.jpg" alt="Cambook" width="%" height="">
                        <figcaption>3. Cambook</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This was an optional extra project for the Information Systems Analysis and Design. We were asked to create a
                        web based app of our choice. We chose to make an application for booking camping spots, using HTML, CSS for the
                        frontend and SpringbBoot for the backend of the project. In the images above you can see the home page and the
                        login page of our website. My teammates for this project were: Anastasiadou Konstantina (3180009) and Fourtouni Eleni (3180196).</p>
